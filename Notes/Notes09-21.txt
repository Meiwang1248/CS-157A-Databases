Logical Database Model:

We’ll be using Entity/Relationship Diagram Models -E/R
	These are used to map the logical model to the physical model (relational model-> relations)

E/R Model and Diagrams–

Allows for the sketching of a database and schema design 
	Include some constraints 

*Entity sets are represented as rectangles 
*Attributes are drawn outside of the entity sets and are circle. They are then connected to the entity sets.

Entity Sets–

Entity: “thing” or an object (tuple in physical level)
Entity Set: collection of similar entities; typically implemented as a relations (relation in physical level)
Attribute: property of an entity set
	Attributes are simple values, e.g. integers or character strings
Relationships = connection between two or more entity sets - binary or multi-way relationships.

Relationships–

Most common relationship is binary or ternary, but more is rare. 
These are represented in the drawing as diamond with lines to each of the entity sets involved. 
	These can be bi-directional or uni-directional
A solid line connection to two entity sets is a many-to-many relationship 

Relationship Set–

The current “value” of an entity set is the set of entity that belong to it. 
	The “value” of a a relationship is a relationship set, a set of tuples with one tuple for each related entities from the relevant entity sets. 
We can add attributes that are owned by the relationship set of the two entity sets 

Many->One & Many->Many & One->One Relationships 

Many->One: Connection entity sets which will have either 0 or 1 connection to 1 connection in the other table. 
One->Many: there is either 0 or 1 connection that is related to 0 or more entities (tuples)
	*Many-Many is a Many->One relationship in both directions i.e. special case 
One->One: A tuple in one table will relate to 0 or 1 tuples in another table 
*Note, exactly ONE will be represented by a rounded arrow –) / SQL ONE will be represented with an arrow –> /
